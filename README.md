# Artificial Intelligence Classes

- You can use any IDE, we suggest using [`Google Colab`](https://colab.research.google.com/) as it requires no set up.

## Notebooks:
Practice Notebooks without solution
  - Week 1:
    - [`python_revision_student.ipynb`](https://github.com/tgvp/ai/blob/main/Week%201/python_revision_student.ipynb)
  
  - Week 2:
    - [`turing-machine-student.ipynb`](https://github.com/tgvp/ai/blob/main/Week%202/week-2-turing-machine-student.ipynb)

  - Week 3:
    - [`neural_nets_student.ipynb`](https://github.com/tgvp/ai/blob/main/Week%203/week_3_neural_nets_student.ipynb)

## Solutions:
Solutions will be only avaialable a week after working with the practical notebook in classroom.

  - Week 1:
    - 
  - Week 2:
    - [`turing_machine_solution.ipynb`](https://github.com/tgvp/ai/blob/main/Week%202/week_2_turing_machine_solution.ipynb)
